# What is this?
This is a simple smart contract for the fabric blockchain which stores and retrieve strings.

It exposes 2 functions:
- `Store`: takes as input a string, generates a key from it, stores the key-value and returns the key
- `Retrieve`: takes as input the key and return the relative string
